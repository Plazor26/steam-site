# Steam Picker

**AI-powered recommendation engine for Steam gamers.**
A small, fun project built in one weekend to explore **machine learning in client-side browsers**.

Steam Picker connects to your Steam profile and:

* Recommends the best games you already own but haven’t played
* Suggests games currently on sale that match your existing taste
* Surfaces personalized insights about your library and play habits
* Generates lighthearted cards that roast or flex your gaming style

Free, open source, and evolving. Inspired by the upcoming Steam Sale.

## 💡 Inspiration

Built over a single weekend as a fun experiment in **browser-side ML**, timed with the Steam Sale.
The goal: make backlogs less overwhelming and game discovery more fun.

Do you want me to also draft a **short “Known Bugs / To-Do” section** so you look even more transparent and engaged with contributions?
